surprise facebook doesnt like privacy countermeasures jwz nesquik bunny dances to patriotic jesus more on nym wars surprise facebook doesn like privacy countermeasures sep german tech news site heise changed their like buttons to be locally hosted images that only transform into real facebook like buttons once you click them meaning that if you don click anything facebook can track you and that actually liking the page requires two clicks also presumably meaning that the page loads way faster facebook responds the manner in which have incorporated the heise de like button violates our platform policies tina kulow said of facebook to heise online policies in these states 8th you must not use or make derivative use of facebook icons or use terms for facebook features and functionality if such use could confuse users into thinking that the reference is to facebook features or functionality loosely translated one must use one that is only for facebook icon facebook features this is precisely the click solution to the case the only difference from conventional solutions is that these buttons before transferring any data to an explicit activation facebook how exactly violate this privacy friendly click solution to this paragraph shall is not yet clear facebook has also mentioned in our article on the occasion of the web site of the radio station swr asked to remove their similarly implemented privacy friendly click solution if it hadn occurred to you yet that facebook cares far more about the like buttons that you don click than about the ones that you do there you go had been considering doing this two click thing solely to speed up my page loads find myself somewhat more motivated to do so now though it still sounds like kind of pain in the butt tags corporations doomed security www permalink shortlink nesquik bunny dances to patriotic jesus more on nym wars responses to surprise facebook doesn like privacy countermeasures john adams says sep at pm just about everyone wants the pre click data problem is that in germany this sort of pre click tracking on the part of facebook is illegal reply andy says sep at pm to make it even better it arguably violation of european data privacy law for european website to include non privacy protecting like button on their website since facebook doesn comply with data privacy requirements basically if company keeps database about person they must disclose the information to the person on request delete the information if requested correct the information if it is wrong and maintain it securely against breaches with real consequences if breached it illegal for company to export personally identifying information to avoid the requirements of the data privacy laws reply lafinjack says sep at pm reply bryan says sep at pm ve been using sharemenot for few weeks without any problems http sharemenot cs washington edu reply elusis says sep at pm previously installed it at the time as well and concur that it seems to have been working fine with no apparent problems reply nako says sep at pm is there something like sharemenot but for the opera browser reply tyler says sep at pm yes it this extension called chrome reply cam says sep at am try ghostery reply elusis says sep at pm congratulations on failing to read the link reply nick lamb says sep at am does the self hosted option of http sharenice org website technical make it any less of pain in the backside all that facebook can do if you violate their policies is shut off your facebook access and cut into its own market share reply aristotle pagaltzis says sep at am here proper translation the manner in which heise de incorporated the like button violates our platform policies tina kulow of facebook explained to heiseonline they state you must not use or make derivative use of facebook icons or use terms for facebook features and functionality if such use could confuse users into thinking that the reference is to facebook features or functionality loosely translated this means you may only use facebook icons for facebook functionality however this is in fact the case for the click solution the only difference from conventional solutions that these buttons will not transmit any data to facebook prior to explicit activation it remains unclear exactly how this data privacy conscious solution is supposed to violate the named clause furthermore following the mention in our article facebook have also sent the website of swr radio request to remove their similarly implemented privacy friendly click solution and the first update meanwhile andreas van de castel of facebook substantiated the complaint section forbids the imitation of facebook functionality you have done just that by using the like button he explained his interpretation of the situation de castel is responsible for social plugins at facebook however these click buttons use facebook functionality without any modification and differ only in how they are incorporated should heiseonline not heed the request to stop this purported abuse then the application would be blocked which would be done based on its app id and repeated non policy conforming incorporation would result in blacklisting of the domain on facebook this would mean that heise de contents could no longer be shared on facebook de castel explained the further consequences beautiful threat update tina kulow of facebookgermany has spoken again in tweet she wrote to clarify click button is not ideal but not problem only like button that merely visually pretends to be one is not ok that all since heiseonline changed the design of the button for the first click that activates the like function there should now be no obstacles on facebook part to further use of the click button by heiseonline and other websites reply samuel says sep at am what about button that turns into facebook button if you mouseover it for more than second reply breton plumbroke says sep at am or hoverintent js reply martijn coppoolse says sep at am that would actually be brilliant only turn it into real facebook button once the mouse slows down enough to suggest the user is going to hover over it until facebook changes their policy that is reply jeffrey paul says sep at am the concept of mouseover does not exist on the many dozens of millions of computers in use for web browsing today that do not use mice android ios etc reply mjgoins says sep at am you could take the facebook buttons off your site reply pingback facebook will soon know exactly how many visitors you got on your site viktor petersson com catfrog says sep at am im going to have to agree with mjgoins just take facebook off your site reply jwz says sep at am don be fucking idiot do you think they re there because like facebook or think they re pretty they re there because running fucking business and this is how you promote in the twenty first century reply dfb says sep at pm honestly don understand how this works because have no facebook account with the like buttons if lot of people click them or visit the pages that they are on where and how does the resulting promotion occur is there any way to measure how much traffic they are driving reply colin says sep at pm it shows up in the feed of their friends when someone likes something dna pizza huh if joe likes it maybe it good basically free advertising for the people using the like buttons while fb chews through everyone online activity and uses it to make their own ads more attractive to advertisers reply satya prakash says sep at am what if use on mouse over like event to simulate this also feel pain in this kind of situation that on every page load we pay to price to social networking sites in terms of speed reply bob bob says sep at am suggest perhaps the problem is that there are still places where pre click tracking is not illegal reply alectic says sep at am fairly sure that facebook like buttons load through an iframe so they load asynchronously and their presence shouldn affect the speed of the site they are on reply jwz says sep at am that fascinating and wrong theory reply alectic says sep at pm can you be more specific looking at the like button on this very site and see that it an iframe as far as iframes blocking the page load in general afaik most browsers will block the window onload event for page until their contents are loaded only if the iframe is part of the original dom of the page however if the iframe is generated by script as is the case with fb like buttons take look at the js source in this page and inserted into the dom by the script most browsers that know of will not block the onload event reply jwz says sep at pm yes it is an iframe and yes it slows down the page load lot read the comments on the considering link reply alectic says sep at pm interesting thanks see some js for google on that calendars page but don see the same js to dynamically inject the fb like button am missing something are they different implementations of the fb like button didn dig in too deep have to head out but might play later assuming am just missing the js to inject the iframe wonder why iframes slow things down so much ran only to be fair profile in chrome on that calendars page and the bulk of the time was spent on garbage collection reply breton plumbroke says sep at pm you re looking at the wrong profiling panel try net reply alectic says sep at pm the network timeline is interesting as well according to that after loading the page few times times to eyeball outliers it looks like window onload was blocked by all the gallery pictures not the iframes the last of all the facebook and google resources appear to have loaded 3seconds before those gallery pictures finished at around the 25second mark alectic says sep at pm where the whole page typically took around 6secs localpcguy says sep at pm there actually is versions of the facebook like button one that uses an iframe directly in the html code of the page and one that dynamically inserts an iframe into the page through js in my experience the js version does tend to make the page feel slower because the like button pops up often after the page is displayed if you are not careful while coding it this can also cause issues with your page layout the iframe version tends to reserve the space immediately and seems to be more responsive about showing immediate have heard that if you have too many iframes on page the entire page becomes less responsive and think this would be where the js version becomes preferable the ability to control when the facebook like buttons are generated on the page is vital to how your page feels to the end user rather the like buttons take an extra 3s to show up rather than have it slow down the entire page move all my facebook like button generating code out of the body of the html and into function that call after the dom is loaded and sometimes even after ve done some other functions first depending on the site and how critical on load js actions are to the site reply shay says sep at pm not developer but from what know about iframe behavior it exactly the opposite of what you say reply pingback the web cold war and data race barbarism francis avila says sep at am ve long used homebrew solution where the social networking buttons facebook google etc only load after being in view for certain amount of time determine this with an event handler for the window scroll event to help performance it only does visibility check few times second not every time the scroll event is fired and it memoizes list of dom nodes to check and their coordinate positions on initialization after that it just matter of finding the document coordinates of the viewport and doing some math to see which dom nodes are visible if it visible copy data src attribute value to the src attribute value and remove the dom node from the check list this loads the iframe if this is not pretty enough you can replace an image with constructed iframe this approach has worked very well for us and users seem to not mind it obviously you need javascript which you mostly need anyway for those buttons but it works on mobile browsers and solves the big page load slowdown from loading all those iframes at once it doesn help for privacy though since no explicit user action is necessary to load the button that requires click solution of some kind reply pingback las moscas de las redes sociales una manera de recopilar informaci sobre ti otro blog pingback alkammy says sep at am http hackerne ws item id instructions to disable all preclick tracking for facebook client side obviously reply jean fran ois audenard says sep at am wrote an article on this topic written in french http blogs orange business com securite les widgets des reseaux sociaux sont des chevaux de troie html reply pingback heises click solution for facebook privacy digitivity dfb says sep at pm google doesn seem to do this by default 1s people click are accessible but do not show up by default so would recommend if page load time is improved more than few dozen milliseconds just using the facebook like and save the google for until they ever do anything with it on the other hand maybe it influences search results at my caring threshold reply dfb says sep at pm the parent comment was supposed to be reply to colin explanation of what facebook like do reply pingback how does facebook use pre click data from like buttons quora phuzz says sep at am knew there was good reason have the entire facebook domain blocked through adblock reply andrew says sep at am you are all retards all of you the text facebook sent is about using their corporate brand and images in your page under false pretences the site clearly doesn have the right to appropriate the like button and change its behaviour clicks as they are damaging facebooks brand by having an inconsistent user interface facebook have to enforce this rule as this could be the thin end of the wedge if they used their own image that you have to click to enable the facebook like button that would be fine reply leave reply cancel reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked connect with facebookname email website comment you may use these html tags and
