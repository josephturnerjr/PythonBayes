## Goal 

Create a system that uses Bayesian inference to determine which submitted articles make it to the frontpage of HackerNews (http://news.ycombinator.com)

## Reality

A dirt simple Naive Bayes model applied to poorly-scraped text from submitted articles, many of which are not even retrievable. 

## Point

None, really, just a little toy inspired by a reading of Mitchell's excellent text, Machine Learning (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html).
